 @ @ - 99 , 6 + 99 , 8 @ @ The repository is organized in four Gradle projects : 
 * The root folder is another Gradle project and all it does is orchestrating the other jobs 
 
 This means that ` . / gradlew clean ` and ` . / gradlew cleanExamples ` will fail if ` assembleExamples ` has not been executed first . 
 + Note that IntelliJ [ does not support multiple projects in the same window ] ( https : / / youtrack . jetbrains . com / issue / IDEABKL - 6118 # )
