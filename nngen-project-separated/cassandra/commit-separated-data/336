 + 
 + Managing libraries for Cassandra is a bit less straight forward compared to other projects , as the build process is based on ant , maven and manually managed jars . Make sure to follow the steps below carefully and pay attention to any emerging issues in the : doc : ` ci ` and reported related issues on Jira / ML , in case of any project dependency changes . 
 + 
 + As Cassandra is an Apache product , all included libraries must follow Apache ' s ` software license requirements < https : / / www . apache . org / legal / resolved . html > ` _ . 
 + 
 + Required steps to add or update libraries 
 + = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
 + 
 + * Add or replace jar file in ` ` lib ` ` directory 
 + * Add or update ` ` lib / license ` ` files 
 + * Update dependencies in ` ` build . xml ` ` 
 + 
 + * Add to ` ` parent - pom ` ` with correct version 
 + * Add to ` ` all - pom ` ` if simple Cassandra dependency ( see below ) 
 + 
 + 
 + POM file types 
 + = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
 + 
 + * * * parent - pom * * - contains all dependencies with the respective version . All other poms will refer to the artifacts with specified versions listed here . 
 + * * * build - deps - pom ( - sources ) * * + * * coverage - deps - pom * * - used by ` ` ant build ` ` compile target . Listed dependenices will be resolved and copied to ` ` build / lib / { jar , sources } ` ` by executing the ` ` maven - ant - tasks - retrieve - build ` ` target . This should contain libraries that are required for build tools ( grammar , docs , instrumentation ) , but are not shipped as part of the Cassandra distribution . 
 + * * * test - deps - pom * * - refered by ` ` maven - ant - tasks - retrieve - test ` ` to retrieve and save dependencies to ` ` build / test / lib ` ` . Exclusively used during JUnit test execution . 
 + * * * all - pom * * - pom for ` cassandra - all . jar < https : / / mvnrepository . com / artifact / org . apache . cassandra / cassandra - all > ` _ that can be installed or deployed to public maven repos via ` ` ant publish ` ` 
 + * * * dist - pom * * - pom for tarball distribution ( cassandra - { bin , src } . tar . gz ) created by ` ` ant artifacts ` ` . Should be left as is , but needed for installing or deploying releases .

 + 
 + Troubleshooting and conflict resolution 
 + = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
 + 
 + Here are some useful commands that may help you out resolving conflicts . 
 + 
 + * ` ` ant realclean ` ` - gets rid of the build directory , including build artifacts . 
 + * ` ` mvn dependency : tree - f build / apache - cassandra - * - SNAPSHOT . pom - Dverbose - Dincludes = org . slf4j ` ` - shows transitive dependency tree for artifacts , e . g . org . slf4j . In case the command above fails due to a missing parent pom file , try running ` ` ant mvn - install ` ` . 
 + * ` ` rm ~ / . m2 / repository / org / apache / cassandra / apache - cassandra / ` ` - removes cached local Cassandra maven artifacts
