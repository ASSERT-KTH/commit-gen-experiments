 - Logs written to stdout are now consistent with logs written to files . 
 Time is now local ( it was UTC on the console and local in files ) . Date , thread , file 
 and line info where added to stdout . ( see CASSANDRA - 12004 ) 
 + - The ' clientutil ' jar , which has been somewhat broken on the 3 . x branch , is not longer provided . 
 + The features provided by that jar are provided by any good java driver and we advise relying on drivers rather on 
 + that jar , but if you need that jar for backward compatiblity until you do so , you should use the version provided 
 + on previous Cassandra branch , like the 3 . 0 branch ( by design , the functionality provided by that jar are stable 
 + accross versions so using the 3 . 0 jar for a client connecting to 3 . x should work without issues ) .
