 + Memtables are in - memory structures where Cassandra buffers writes . In general , there is one active memtable per table . 
 + Eventually , memtables are flushed onto disk and become immutable ` SSTables ` _ . This can be triggered in several 
 + ways : 
 + 
 + - The memory usage of the memtables exceeds the configured threshold ( see ` ` memtable _ cleanup _ threshold ` ` ) 
 + - The : ref : ` commit - log ` approaches its maximum size , and forces memtable flushes in order to allow commitlog segments to 
 + be freed 
 + 
 + Memtables may be stored entirely on - heap or partially off - heap , depending on ` ` memtable _ allocation _ type ` ` .

 + SSTables are the immutable data files that Cassandra uses for persisting data on disk . 
 + 
 + As SSTables are flushed to disk from : ref : ` memtables ` or are streamed from other nodes , Cassandra triggers compactions 
 + which combine multiple SSTables into one . Once the new SSTable has been written , the old SSTables can be removed . 
 + 
 + Each SSTable is comprised of multiple components stored in separate files : 
 + 
 + ` ` Data . db ` ` 
 + The actual data , i . e . the contents of rows . 
 + 
 + ` ` Index . db ` ` 
 + An index from partition keys to positions in the ` ` Data . db ` ` file . For wide partitions , this may also include an 
 + index to rows within a partition . 
 + 
 + ` ` Summary . db ` ` 
 + A sampling of ( by default ) every 128th entry in the ` ` Index . db ` ` file . 
 + 
 + ` ` Filter . db ` ` 
 + A Bloom Filter of the partition keys in the SSTable . 
 + 
 + ` ` CompressionInfo . db ` ` 
 + Metadata about the offsets and lengths of compression chunks in the ` ` Data . db ` ` file . 
 + 
 + ` ` Statistics . db ` ` 
 + Stores metadata about the SSTable , including information about timestamps , tombstones , clustering keys , compaction , 
 + repair , compression , TTLs , and more . 
 + 
 + ` ` Digest . crc32 ` ` 
 + A CRC - 32 digest of the ` ` Data . db ` ` file . 
 + 
 + ` ` TOC . txt ` `

 + 
 + Within the ` ` Data . db ` ` file , rows are organized by partition . These partitions are sorted in token order ( i . e . by a
