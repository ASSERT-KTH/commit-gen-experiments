 By default , these features are disabled as Cassandra is configured to easily find and be found by other members of a 
 cluster . In other words , an out - of - the - box Cassandra installation presents a large attack surface for a bad actor . 
 - Possible attack vectors include : 
 + Enabling authentication for clients using the binary protocol is not sufficient to protect a cluster . Malicious users 
 + able to access internode communication and JMX ports can still : 
 
 - - Crafted internode messages to insert users into authentication schema 
 - - Crafted internode messages to truncate or drop schema 
 - - Use of tools such as ` ` sstableloader ` ` to overwrite ` ` system _ auth ` ` tables 
 - - Attaching to the cluster directly to capture write traffic

 Correct configuration of all three security components should negate theses vectors . Therefore , understanding Cassandra ' s 
 security features is crucial to configuring your cluster to meet your security needs .
