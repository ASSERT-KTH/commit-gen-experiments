 - To install this source code for development purposes , extract this zip file . 
 - It ships with a demonstration mod . Run ' gradlew setupDevWorkspace ' to create 
 - a gradle environment primed with FML . Run ' gradlew eclipse ' or ' gradlew idea ' to 
 - create an IDE workspace of your choice .

 - Note : On macs or linux you run the ' . / gradlew . sh ' instead of ' gradlew ' 
 + Step 1 : Open your command - line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file . 
 + 
 + Step 2 : Once you have a command window up in the folder that the downloaded material was placed , type : 
 + 
 + Windows : " gradlew setupDecompWorkspace " 
 + Linux / Mac OS : " . / gradlew setupDecompWorkspace " 
 + 
 + Step 3 : After all that finished , you ' re left with a choice . 
 + For eclipse , run " gradlew eclipse " ( . / gradlew eclipse if you are on Mac / Linux ) 
 + 
 + If you preffer to use IntelliJ , steps are a little different . 
 + 1 . Open IDEA , and import project .

 + 
 + Step 4 : The final step is to open Eclipse and switch your workspace to / eclipse / ( if you use IDEA , it should automatically start on your project ) 
 + 
 + If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE , or you ' ve run into problems you can run " gradlew - - refresh - dependencies " to refresh the local cache . " gradlew clean " to reset everything { this does not effect your code } and then start the processs again . 
 + 
 + Should it still not work , 
 + Refer to # ForgeGradle on EsperNet for more information about the gradle environment . 
 + 
 + Tip : 
 + If you do not care about seeing Minecraft ' s source code you can replace " setupDecompWorkspace " with one of the following : 
 + " setupDevWorkspace " : Will patch , deobfusicated , and gather required assets to run minecraft , but will not generated human readable source code .
