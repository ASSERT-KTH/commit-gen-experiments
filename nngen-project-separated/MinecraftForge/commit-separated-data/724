It also counts <nl> + as the successor of the GNU Library Public License , version 2 , hence <nl> + the version number 2 . 1 . ] <nl> + <nl> + Preamble <nl> + <nl> + The licenses for most software are designed to take away your <nl> + freedom to share and change it . By contrast , the GNU General Public <nl> + Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change <nl> + free software - - to make sure the software is free for all its users . <nl> + <nl> + This license , the Lesser General Public License , applies to some <nl> + specially designated software packages - - typically libraries - - of the <nl> + Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it . You <nl> + can use it too , but we suggest you first think carefully about whether <nl> + this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better <nl> + strategy to use in any particular case , based on the explanations below . <nl> + <nl> + When we speak of free software , we are referring to freedom of use , <nl> + not price . Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that <nl> + you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software ( and charge <nl> + for this service if you wish ) ; that you receive source code or can get <nl> + it if you want it ; that you can change the software and use pieces of <nl> + it in new free programs ; and that you are informed that you can do <nl> + these things . <nl> + <nl> + To protect your rights , we need to make restrictions that forbid <nl> + distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these <nl> + rights . These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for <nl> + you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it . <nl> + <nl> + For example , if you distribute copies of the library , whether gratis <nl> + or for a fee , you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave <nl> + you . You must make sure that they , too , receive or can get the source <nl> + code . If you link other code with the library , you must provide <nl> + complete object files to the recipients , so that they can relink them <nl> + with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling <nl> + it . And you must show them these terms so they know their rights . <nl> + <nl> + We protect your rights with a two - step method : ( 1 ) we copyright the <nl> + library , and ( 2 ) we offer you this license , which gives you legal <nl> + permission to copy , distribute and / or modify the library . <nl> + <nl> + To protect each distributor , we want to make it very clear that <nl> + there is no warranty for the free library . Also , if the library is <nl> + modified by someone else and passed on , the recipients should know <nl> + that what they have is not the original version , so that the original <nl> + author ' s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be <nl> + introduced by others . <nl> +  <nl> + Finally , software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of <nl> + any free program . We wish to make sure that a company cannot <nl> + effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a <nl> + restrictive license from a patent holder . Therefore , we insist that <nl> + any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be <nl> + consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license . <nl> + <nl> + Most GNU software , including some libraries , is covered by the <nl> + ordinary GNU General Public License . This license , the GNU Lesser <nl> + General Public License , applies to certain designated libraries , and <nl> + is quite different from the ordinary General Public License . We use <nl> + this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those <nl> + libraries into non - free programs . <nl> + <nl> + When a program is linked with a library , whether statically or using <nl> + a shared library , the combination of the two is legally speaking a <nl> + combined work , a derivative of the original library . The ordinary <nl> + General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the <nl> + entire combination fits its criteria of freedom . The Lesser General <nl> + Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with <nl> + the library . <nl> + <nl> + We call this license the " Lesser " General Public License because it <nl> + does Less to protect the user ' s freedom than the ordinary General <nl> + Public License . It also provides other free software developers Less <nl> + of an advantage over competing non - free programs . These disadvantages <nl> + are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many <nl> + libraries . However , the Lesser license provides advantages in certain <nl> + special circumstances . <nl> + <nl> + For example , on rare occasions , there may be a special need to <nl> + encourage the widest possible use of a certain library , so that it becomes <nl> + a de - facto standard . To achieve this , non - free programs must be <nl> + allowed to use the library . A more frequent case is that a free <nl> + library does the same job as widely used non - free libraries . In this <nl> + case , there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free <nl> + software only , so we use the Lesser General Public License . <nl> + <nl> + In other cases , permission to use a particular library in non - free <nl> + programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of <nl> + free software . For example , permission to use the GNU C Library in <nl> + non - free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU <nl> + operating system , as well as its variant , the GNU / Linux operating <nl> + system . <nl> + <nl> + Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the <nl> + users ' freedom , it does ensure that the user of a program that is <nl> + linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run <nl> + that program using a modified version of the Library . <nl> + <nl> + The precise terms and conditions for copying , distribution and <nl> + modification follow . Pay close attention to the difference between a <nl> + " work based on the library " and a " work that uses the library " . The <nl> + former contains code derived from the library , whereas the latter must <nl> + be combined with the library in order to run . <nl> +  <nl> + GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE <nl> + TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING , DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <nl> + <nl> + 0 . This License Agreement applies to any software library or other <nl> + program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or <nl> + other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of <nl> + this Lesser General Public License ( also called " this License " ) . <nl> + Each licensee is addressed as " you " . <nl> + <nl> + A " library " means a collection of software functions and / or data <nl> + prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs <nl> + ( which use some of those functions and data ) to form executables . <nl> + <nl> + The " Library " , below , refers to any such software library or work <nl> + which has been distributed under these terms . A " work based on the <nl> + Library " means either the Library or any derivative work under <nl> + copyright law : that is to say , a work containing the Library or a <nl> + portion of it , either verbatim or with modifications and / or translated <nl> + straightforwardly into another language . ( Hereinafter , translation is <nl> + included without limitation in the term " modification " . ) <nl> + <nl> + " Source code " for a work means the preferred form of the work for <nl> + making modifications to it . For a library , complete source code means <nl> + all the source code for all modules it contains , plus any associated <nl> + interface definition files , plus the scripts used to control compilation <nl> + and installation of the library . <nl> + <nl> + Activities other than copying , distribution and modification are not <nl> + covered by this License ; they are outside its scope . The act of <nl> + running a program using the Library is not restricted , and output from <nl> + such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based <nl> + on the Library ( independent of the use of the Library in a tool for <nl> + writing it ) . Whether that is true depends on what the Library does <nl> + and what the program that uses the Library does . <nl> + <nl> + 1 . You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library ' s <nl> + complete source code as you receive it , in any medium , provided that <nl> + you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an <nl> + appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty ; keep intact <nl> + all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any <nl> + warranty ; and distribute a copy of this License along with the <nl> + Library . <nl> + <nl> + You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy , <nl> + and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a <nl> + fee . <nl> +  <nl> + 2 . You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion <nl> + of it , thus forming a work based on the Library , and copy and <nl> + distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 <nl> + above , provided that you also meet all of these conditions : <nl> + <nl> + a ) The modified work must itself be a software library . <nl> + <nl> + b ) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices <nl> + stating that you changed the files and the date of any change . <nl> + <nl> + c ) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no <nl> + charge to all third parties under the terms of this License . <nl> + <nl> + d ) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a <nl> + table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses <nl> + the facility , other than as an argument passed when the facility <nl> + is invoked , then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that , <nl> + in the event an application does not supply such function or <nl> + table , the facility still operates , and performs whatever part of <nl> + its purpose remains meaningful . <nl> + <nl> + ( For example , a function in a library to compute square roots has <nl> + a purpose that is entirely well - defined independent of the <nl> + application . Therefore , Subsection 2d requires that any <nl> + application - supplied function or table used by this function must <nl> + be optional : if the application does not supply it , the square <nl> + root function must still compute square roots . ) <nl> + <nl> + These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole . If <nl> + identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library , <nl> + and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in <nl> + themselves , then this License , and its terms , do not apply to those <nl> + sections when you distribute them as separate works . But when you <nl> + distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based <nl> + on the Library , the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of <nl> + this License , whose permissions for other licensees extend to the <nl> + entire whole , and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote <nl> + it . <nl> + <nl> + Thus , it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest <nl> + your rights to work written entirely by you ; rather , the intent is to <nl> + exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or <nl> + collective works based on the Library . <nl> + <nl> + In addition , mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library <nl> + with the Library ( or with a work based on the Library ) on a volume of <nl> + a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under <nl> + the scope of this License . <nl> + <nl> + 3 . You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public <nl> + License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library . To do <nl> + this , you must alter all the notices that refer to this License , so <nl> + that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License , version 2 , <nl> + instead of to this License . ( If a newer version than version 2 of the <nl> + ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared , then you can specify <nl> + that version instead if you wish . ) Do not make any other change in <nl> + these notices . <nl> +  <nl> + Once this change is made in a given copy , it is irreversible for <nl> + that copy , so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all <nl> + subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy . <nl> + <nl> + This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of <nl> + the Library into a program that is not a library . <nl> + <nl> + 4 . You may copy and distribute the Library ( or a portion or <nl> + derivative of it , under Section 2 ) in object code or executable form <nl> + under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany <nl> + it with the complete corresponding machine - readable source code , which <nl> + must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a <nl> + medium customarily used for software interchange . <nl> + <nl> + If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy <nl> + from a designated place , then offering equivalent access to copy the <nl> + source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to <nl> + distribute the source code , even though third parties are not <nl> + compelled to copy the source along with the object code . <nl> + <nl> + 5 . A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the <nl> + Library , but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or <nl> + linked with it , is called a " work that uses the Library " . Such a <nl> + work , in isolation , is not a derivative work of the Library , and <nl> + therefore falls outside the scope of this License . <nl> + <nl> + However , linking a " work that uses the Library " with the Library <nl> + creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library ( because it <nl> + contains portions of the Library ) , rather than a " work that uses the <nl> + library " . The executable is therefore covered by this License . <nl> + Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables . <nl> + <nl> + When a " work that uses the Library " uses material from a header file <nl> + that is part of the Library , the object code for the work may be a <nl> + derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not . <nl> + Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be <nl> + linked without the Library , or if the work is itself a library . The <nl> + threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law . <nl> + <nl> + If such an object file uses only numerical parameters , data <nl> + structure layouts and accessors , and small macros and small inline <nl> + functions ( ten lines or less in length ) , then the use of the object <nl> + file is unrestricted , regardless of whether it is legally a derivative <nl> + work . ( Executables containing this object code plus portions of the <nl> + Library will still fall under Section 6 . ) <nl> + <nl> + Otherwise , if the work is a derivative of the Library , you may <nl> + distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6 . <nl> + Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6 , <nl> + whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself . <nl> +  <nl> + 6 . As an exception to the Sections above , you may also combine or <nl> + link a " work that uses the Library " with the Library to produce a <nl> + work containing portions of the Library , and distribute that work <nl> + under terms of your choice , provided that the terms permit <nl> + modification of the work for the customer ' s own use and reverse <nl> + engineering for debugging such modifications . <nl> + <nl> + You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the <nl> + Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by <nl> + this License . You must supply a copy of this License . If the work <nl> + during execution displays copyright notices , you must include the <nl> + copyright notice for the Library among them , as well as a reference <nl> + directing the user to the copy of this License . Also , you must do one <nl> + of these things : <nl> + <nl> + a ) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding <nl> + machine - readable source code for the Library including whatever <nl> + changes were used in the work ( which must be distributed under <nl> + Sections 1 and 2 above ) ; and , if the work is an executable linked <nl> + with the Library , with the complete machine - readable " work that <nl> + uses the Library " , as object code and / or source code , so that the <nl> + user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified <nl> + executable containing the modified Library . ( It is understood <nl> + that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the <nl> + Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application <nl> + to use the modified definitions . ) <nl> + <nl> + b ) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the <nl> + Library . A suitable mechanism is one that ( 1 ) uses at run time a <nl> + copy of the library already present on the user ' s computer system , <nl> + rather than copying library functions into the executable , and ( 2 ) <nl> + will operate properly with a modified version of the library , if <nl> + the user installs one , as long as the modified version is <nl> + interface - compatible with the version that the work was made with . <nl> + <nl> + c ) Accompany the work with a written offer , valid for at <nl> + least three years , to give the same user the materials <nl> + specified in Subsection 6a , above , for a charge no more <nl> + than the cost of performing this distribution . <nl> + <nl> + d ) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy <nl> + from a designated place , offer equivalent access to copy the above <nl> + specified materials from the same place . <nl> + <nl> + e ) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these <nl> + materials or that you have already sent this user a copy . <nl> + <nl> + For an executable , the required form of the " work that uses the <nl> + Library " must include any data and utility programs needed for <nl> + reproducing the executable from it . However , as a special exception , <nl> + the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is <nl> + normally distributed ( in either source or binary form ) with the major <nl> + components ( compiler , kernel , and so on ) of the operating system on <nl> + which the executable runs , unless that component itself accompanies <nl> + the executable . <nl> + <nl> + It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license <nl> + restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally <nl> + accompany the operating system . Such a contradiction means you cannot <nl> + use both them and the Library together in an executable that you <nl> + distribute . <nl> +  <nl> + 7 . You may place library facilities that are a work based on the <nl> + Library side - by - side in a single library together with other library <nl> + facilities not covered by this License , and distribute such a combined <nl> + library , provided that the separate distribution of the work based on <nl> + the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise <nl> + permitted , and provided that you do these two things : <nl> + <nl> + a ) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work <nl> + based on the Library , uncombined with any other library <nl> + facilities . This must be distributed under the terms of the <nl> + Sections above . <nl> + <nl> + b ) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact <nl> + that part of it is a work based on the Library , and explaining <nl> + where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work . <nl> + <nl> + 8 . You may not copy , modify , sublicense , link with , or distribute <nl> + the Library except as expressly provided under this License . Any <nl> + attempt otherwise to copy , modify , sublicense , link with , or <nl> + distribute the Library is void , and will automatically terminate your <nl> + rights under this License . However , parties who have received copies , <nl> + or rights , from you under this License will not have their licenses <nl> + terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance . <nl> + <nl> + 9 . You are not required to accept this License , since you have not <nl> + signed it . However , nothing else grants you permission to modify or <nl> + distribute the Library or its derivative works . These actions are <nl> + prohibited by law if you do not accept this License . Therefore , by <nl> + modifying or distributing the Library ( or any work based on the <nl> + Library ) , you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so , and <nl> + all its terms and conditions for copying , distributing or modifying <nl> + the Library or works based on it . <nl> + <nl> + 10 . Each time you redistribute the Library ( or any work based on the <nl> + Library ) , the recipient automatically receives a license from the <nl> + original licensor to copy , distribute , link with or modify the Library <nl> + subject to these terms and conditions . You may not impose any further <nl> + restrictions on the recipients ' exercise of the rights granted herein . <nl> + You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with <nl> + this License . <nl> +  <nl> + 11 . If , as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent <nl> + infringement or for any other reason ( not limited to patent issues ) , <nl> + conditions are imposed on you ( whether by court order , agreement or <nl> + otherwise ) that contradict the conditions of this License , they do not <nl> + excuse you from the conditions of this License . If you cannot <nl> + distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this <nl> + License and any other pertinent obligations , then as a consequence you <nl> + may not distribute the Library at all . For example , if a patent <nl> + license would not permit royalty - free redistribution of the Library by <nl> + all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you , then <nl> + the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to <nl> + refrain entirely from distribution of the Library . <nl> + <nl> + If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any <nl> + particular circumstance , the balance of the section is intended to apply , <nl> + and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances . <nl> + <nl> + It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any <nl> + patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any <nl> + such claims ; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the <nl> + integrity of the free software distribution system which is <nl> + implemented by public license practices . Many people have made <nl> + generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed <nl> + through that system in reliance on consistent application of that <nl> + system ; it is up to the author / donor to decide if he or she is willing <nl> + to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot <nl> + impose that choice . <nl> + <nl> + This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to <nl> + be a consequence of the rest of this License . <nl> + <nl> + 12 . If the distribution and / or use of the Library is restricted in <nl> + certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces , the <nl> + original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add <nl> + an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries , <nl> + so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus <nl> + excluded . In such case , this License incorporates the limitation as if <nl> + written in the body of this License . <nl> + <nl> + 13 . The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and / or new <nl> + versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time . <nl> + Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version , <nl> + but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns . <nl> + <nl> + Each version is given a distinguishing version number . If the Library <nl> + specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <nl> + " any later version " , you have the option of following the terms and <nl> + conditions either of that version or of any later version published by <nl> + the Free Software Foundation . If the Library does not specify a <nl> + license version number , you may choose any version ever published by <nl> + the Free Software Foundation . <nl> +  <nl> + 14 . If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free <nl> + programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these , <nl> + write to the author to ask for permission . For software which is <nl> + copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation , write to the Free <nl> + Software Foundation ; we sometimes make exceptions for this . Our <nl> + decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status <nl> + of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing <nl> + and reuse of software generally . <nl> + <nl> + NO WARRANTY <nl> + <nl> + 15 . BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE , THERE IS NO <nl> + WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY , TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW . <nl> + EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND / OR <nl> + OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY " AS IS " WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY <nl> + KIND , EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING , BUT NOT LIMITED TO , THE <nl> + IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR <nl> + PURPOSE . THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE <nl> + LIBRARY IS WITH YOU . SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE , YOU ASSUME <nl> + THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING , REPAIR OR CORRECTION . <nl> + <nl> + 16 . IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN <nl> + WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER , OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY <nl> + AND / OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE , BE LIABLE TO YOU <nl> + FOR DAMAGES , INCLUDING ANY GENERAL , SPECIAL , INCIDENTAL OR <nl> + CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE <nl> + LIBRARY ( INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING <nl> + RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A <nl> + FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE ) , EVEN IF <nl> + SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH <nl> + DAMAGES . <nl> + <nl> + END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 + Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 + of this license document , but changing it is not allowed . 
 + 
 + [ This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL . It also counts 
 + as the successor of the GNU Library Public License , version 2 , hence 
 + the version number 2 . 1 . ] 
 + 
 + Preamble 
 + 
 + The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
 + freedom to share and change it . By contrast , the GNU General Public 
 + Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
 + free software - - to make sure the software is free for all its users . 
 + 
 + This license , the Lesser General Public License , applies to some 
 + specially designated software packages - - typically libraries - - of the 
 + Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it . You 
 + can use it too , but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 
 + this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 
 + strategy to use in any particular case , based on the explanations below . 
 + 
 + When we speak of free software , we are referring to freedom of use , 
 + not price . Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
 + you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software ( and charge 
 + for this service if you wish ) ; that you receive source code or can get 
 + it if you want it ; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
 + it in new free programs ; and that you are informed that you can do 
 + these things . 
 + 
 + To protect your rights , we need to make restrictions that forbid 
 + distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
 + rights . These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
 + you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it . 
 + 
 + For example , if you distribute copies of the library , whether gratis 
 + or for a fee , you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
 + you . You must make sure that they , too , receive or can get the source 
 + code . If you link other code with the library , you must provide 
 + complete object files to the recipients , so that they can relink them 
 + with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
 + it . And you must show them these terms so they know their rights . 
 + 
 + We protect your rights with a two - step method : ( 1 ) we copyright the 
 + library , and ( 2 ) we offer you this license , which gives you legal 
 + permission to copy , distribute and / or modify the library . 
 + 
 + To protect each distributor , we want to make it very clear that 
 + there is no warranty for the free library . Also , if the library is 
 + modified by someone else and passed on , the recipients should know 
 + that what they have is not the original version , so that the original 
 + author ' s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
 + introduced by others . 
 +  
 + Finally , software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 
 + any free program . We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
 + effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
 + restrictive license from a patent holder . Therefore , we insist that 
 + any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 
 + consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license . 
 + 
 + Most GNU software , including some libraries , is covered by the 
 + ordinary GNU General Public License . This license , the GNU Lesser 
 + General Public License , applies to certain designated libraries , and 
 + is quite different from the ordinary General Public License . We use 
 + this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
 + libraries into non - free programs . 
 + 
 + When a program is linked with a library , whether statically or using 
 + a shared library , the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
 + combined work , a derivative of the original library . The ordinary 
 + General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 
 + entire combination fits its criteria of freedom . The Lesser General 
 + Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 
 + the library . 
 + 
 + We call this license the " Lesser " General Public License because it 
 + does Less to protect the user ' s freedom than the ordinary General 
 + Public License . It also provides other free software developers Less 
 + of an advantage over competing non - free programs . These disadvantages 
 + are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
 + libraries . However , the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
 + special circumstances . 
 + 
 + For example , on rare occasions , there may be a special need to 
 + encourage the widest possible use of a certain library , so that it becomes 
 + a de - facto standard . To achieve this , non - free programs must be 
 + allowed to use the library . A more frequent case is that a free 
 + library does the same job as widely used non - free libraries . In this 
 + case , there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
 + software only , so we use the Lesser General Public License . 
 + 
 + In other cases , permission to use a particular library in non - free 
 + programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 
 + free software . For example , permission to use the GNU C Library in 
 + non - free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
 + operating system , as well as its variant , the GNU / Linux operating 
 + system . 
 + 
 + Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
 + users ' freedom , it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
 + linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
 + that program using a modified version of the Library . 
 + 
 + The precise terms and conditions for copying , distribution and 
 + modification follow . Pay close attention to the difference between a 
 + " work based on the library " and a " work that uses the library " . The 
 + former contains code derived from the library , whereas the latter must 
 + be combined with the library in order to run . 
 +  
 + GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 + TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING , DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 + 
 + 0 . This License Agreement applies to any software library or other 
 + program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or 
 + other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
 + this Lesser General Public License ( also called " this License " ) . 
 + Each licensee is addressed as " you " . 
 + 
 + A " library " means a collection of software functions and / or data 
 + prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
 + ( which use some of those functions and data ) to form executables . 
 + 
 + The " Library " , below , refers to any such software library or work 
 + which has been distributed under these terms . A " work based on the 
 + Library " means either the Library or any derivative work under 
 + copyright law : that is to say , a work containing the Library or a 
 + portion of it , either verbatim or with modifications and / or translated 
 + straightforwardly into another language . ( Hereinafter , translation is 
 + included without limitation in the term " modification " . ) 
 + 
 + " Source code " for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
 + making modifications to it . For a library , complete source code means 
 + all the source code for all modules it contains , plus any associated 
 + interface definition files , plus the scripts used to control compilation 
 + and installation of the library . 
 + 
 + Activities other than copying , distribution and modification are not 
 + covered by this License ; they are outside its scope . The act of 
 + running a program using the Library is not restricted , and output from 
 + such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 
 + on the Library ( independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 
 + writing it ) . Whether that is true depends on what the Library does 
 + and what the program that uses the Library does . 
 + 
 + 1 . You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library ' s 
 + complete source code as you receive it , in any medium , provided that 
 + you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
 + appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty ; keep intact 
 + all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
 + warranty ; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 
 + Library . 
 + 
 + You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy , 
 + and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a 
 + fee . 
 +  
 + 2 . You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion 
 + of it , thus forming a work based on the Library , and copy and 
 + distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
 + above , provided that you also meet all of these conditions : 
 + 
 + a ) The modified work must itself be a software library . 
 + 
 + b ) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
 + stating that you changed the files and the date of any change . 
 + 
 + c ) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no 
 + charge to all third parties under the terms of this License . 
 + 
 + d ) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a 
 + table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses 
 + the facility , other than as an argument passed when the facility 
 + is invoked , then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that , 
 + in the event an application does not supply such function or 
 + table , the facility still operates , and performs whatever part of 
 + its purpose remains meaningful . 
 + 
 + ( For example , a function in a library to compute square roots has 
 + a purpose that is entirely well - defined independent of the 
 + application . Therefore , Subsection 2d requires that any 
 + application - supplied function or table used by this function must 
 + be optional : if the application does not supply it , the square 
 + root function must still compute square roots . ) 
 + 
 + These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole . If 
 + identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library , 
 + and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
 + themselves , then this License , and its terms , do not apply to those 
 + sections when you distribute them as separate works . But when you 
 + distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
 + on the Library , the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
 + this License , whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
 + entire whole , and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
 + it . 
 + 
 + Thus , it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
 + your rights to work written entirely by you ; rather , the intent is to 
 + exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
 + collective works based on the Library . 
 + 
 + In addition , mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
 + with the Library ( or with a work based on the Library ) on a volume of 
 + a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
 + the scope of this License . 
 + 
 + 3 . You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public 
 + License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library . To do 
 + this , you must alter all the notices that refer to this License , so 
 + that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License , version 2 , 
 + instead of to this License . ( If a newer version than version 2 of the 
 + ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared , then you can specify 
 + that version instead if you wish . ) Do not make any other change in 
 + these notices . 
 +  
 + Once this change is made in a given copy , it is irreversible for 
 + that copy , so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
 + subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy . 
 + 
 + This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of 
 + the Library into a program that is not a library . 
 + 
 + 4 . You may copy and distribute the Library ( or a portion or 
 + derivative of it , under Section 2 ) in object code or executable form 
 + under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany 
 + it with the complete corresponding machine - readable source code , which 
 + must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
 + medium customarily used for software interchange . 
 + 
 + If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy 
 + from a designated place , then offering equivalent access to copy the 
 + source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
 + distribute the source code , even though third parties are not 
 + compelled to copy the source along with the object code . 
 + 
 + 5 . A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the 
 + Library , but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or 
 + linked with it , is called a " work that uses the Library " . Such a 
 + work , in isolation , is not a derivative work of the Library , and 
 + therefore falls outside the scope of this License . 
 + 
 + However , linking a " work that uses the Library " with the Library 
 + creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library ( because it 
 + contains portions of the Library ) , rather than a " work that uses the 
 + library " . The executable is therefore covered by this License . 
 + Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables . 
 + 
 + When a " work that uses the Library " uses material from a header file 
 + that is part of the Library , the object code for the work may be a 
 + derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not . 
 + Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
 + linked without the Library , or if the work is itself a library . The 
 + threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law . 
 + 
 + If such an object file uses only numerical parameters , data 
 + structure layouts and accessors , and small macros and small inline 
 + functions ( ten lines or less in length ) , then the use of the object 
 + file is unrestricted , regardless of whether it is legally a derivative 
 + work . ( Executables containing this object code plus portions of the 
 + Library will still fall under Section 6 . ) 
 + 
 + Otherwise , if the work is a derivative of the Library , you may 
 + distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6 . 
 + Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6 , 
 + whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself . 
 +  
 + 6 . As an exception to the Sections above , you may also combine or 
 + link a " work that uses the Library " with the Library to produce a 
 + work containing portions of the Library , and distribute that work 
 + under terms of your choice , provided that the terms permit 
 + modification of the work for the customer ' s own use and reverse 
 + engineering for debugging such modifications . 
 + 
 + You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
 + Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
 + this License . You must supply a copy of this License . If the work 
 + during execution displays copyright notices , you must include the 
 + copyright notice for the Library among them , as well as a reference 
 + directing the user to the copy of this License . Also , you must do one 
 + of these things : 
 + 
 + a ) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
 + machine - readable source code for the Library including whatever 
 + changes were used in the work ( which must be distributed under 
 + Sections 1 and 2 above ) ; and , if the work is an executable linked 
 + with the Library , with the complete machine - readable " work that 
 + uses the Library " , as object code and / or source code , so that the 
 + user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified 
 + executable containing the modified Library . ( It is understood 
 + that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the 
 + Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application 
 + to use the modified definitions . ) 
 + 
 + b ) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
 + Library . A suitable mechanism is one that ( 1 ) uses at run time a 
 + copy of the library already present on the user ' s computer system , 
 + rather than copying library functions into the executable , and ( 2 ) 
 + will operate properly with a modified version of the library , if 
 + the user installs one , as long as the modified version is 
 + interface - compatible with the version that the work was made with . 
 + 
 + c ) Accompany the work with a written offer , valid for at 
 + least three years , to give the same user the materials 
 + specified in Subsection 6a , above , for a charge no more 
 + than the cost of performing this distribution . 
 + 
 + d ) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy 
 + from a designated place , offer equivalent access to copy the above 
 + specified materials from the same place . 
 + 
 + e ) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these 
 + materials or that you have already sent this user a copy . 
 + 
 + For an executable , the required form of the " work that uses the 
 + Library " must include any data and utility programs needed for 
 + reproducing the executable from it . However , as a special exception , 
 + the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 
 + normally distributed ( in either source or binary form ) with the major 
 + components ( compiler , kernel , and so on ) of the operating system on 
 + which the executable runs , unless that component itself accompanies 
 + the executable . 
 + 
 + It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
 + restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
 + accompany the operating system . Such a contradiction means you cannot 
 + use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 
 + distribute . 
 +  
 + 7 . You may place library facilities that are a work based on the 
 + Library side - by - side in a single library together with other library 
 + facilities not covered by this License , and distribute such a combined 
 + library , provided that the separate distribution of the work based on 
 + the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise 
 + permitted , and provided that you do these two things : 
 + 
 + a ) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work 
 + based on the Library , uncombined with any other library 
 + facilities . This must be distributed under the terms of the 
 + Sections above . 
 + 
 + b ) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact 
 + that part of it is a work based on the Library , and explaining 
 + where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work . 
 + 
 + 8 . You may not copy , modify , sublicense , link with , or distribute 
 + the Library except as expressly provided under this License . Any 
 + attempt otherwise to copy , modify , sublicense , link with , or 
 + distribute the Library is void , and will automatically terminate your 
 + rights under this License . However , parties who have received copies , 
 + or rights , from you under this License will not have their licenses 
 + terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance . 
 + 
 + 9 . You are not required to accept this License , since you have not 
 + signed it . However , nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
 + distribute the Library or its derivative works . These actions are 
 + prohibited by law if you do not accept this License . Therefore , by 
 + modifying or distributing the Library ( or any work based on the 
 + Library ) , you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so , and 
 + all its terms and conditions for copying , distributing or modifying 
 + the Library or works based on it . 
 + 
 + 10 . Each time you redistribute the Library ( or any work based on the 
 + Library ) , the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
 + original licensor to copy , distribute , link with or modify the Library 
 + subject to these terms and conditions . You may not impose any further 
 + restrictions on the recipients ' exercise of the rights granted herein . 
 + You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
 + this License . 
 +  
 + 11 . If , as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
 + infringement or for any other reason ( not limited to patent issues ) , 
 + conditions are imposed on you ( whether by court order , agreement or 
 + otherwise ) that contradict the conditions of this License , they do not 
 + excuse you from the conditions of this License . If you cannot 
 + distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
 + License and any other pertinent obligations , then as a consequence you 
 + may not distribute the Library at all . For example , if a patent 
 + license would not permit royalty - free redistribution of the Library by 
 + all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you , then 
 + the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
 + refrain entirely from distribution of the Library . 
 + 
 + If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
 + particular circumstance , the balance of the section is intended to apply , 
 + and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances . 
 + 
 + It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
 + patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
 + such claims ; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
 + integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
 + implemented by public license practices . Many people have made 
 + generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
 + through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
 + system ; it is up to the author / donor to decide if he or she is willing 
 + to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
 + impose that choice . 
 + 
 + This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
 + be a consequence of the rest of this License . 
 + 
 + 12 . If the distribution and / or use of the Library is restricted in 
 + certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces , the 
 + original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add 
 + an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries , 
 + so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus 
 + excluded . In such case , this License incorporates the limitation as if 
 + written in the body of this License . 
 + 
 + 13 . The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and / or new 
 + versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time . 
 + Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version , 
 + but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns . 
 + 
 + Each version is given a distinguishing version number . If the Library 
 + specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
 + " any later version " , you have the option of following the terms and 
 + conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
 + the Free Software Foundation . If the Library does not specify a 
 + license version number , you may choose any version ever published by 
 + the Free Software Foundation . 
 +  
 + 14 . If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 
 + programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these , 
 + write to the author to ask for permission . For software which is 
 + copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation , write to the Free 
 + Software Foundation ; we sometimes make exceptions for this . Our 
 + decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status 
 + of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing 
 + and reuse of software generally . 
 + 
 + NO WARRANTY 
 + 
 + 15 . BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE , THERE IS NO 
 + WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY , TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW . 
 + EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND / OR 
 + OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY " AS IS " WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
 + KIND , EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING , BUT NOT LIMITED TO , THE 
 + IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
 + PURPOSE . THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
 + LIBRARY IS WITH YOU . SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE , YOU ASSUME 
 + THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING , REPAIR OR CORRECTION . 
 + 
 + 16 . IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
 + WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER , OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
 + AND / OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE , BE LIABLE TO YOU 
 + FOR DAMAGES , INCLUDING ANY GENERAL , SPECIAL , INCIDENTAL OR 
 + CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
 + LIBRARY ( INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
 + RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
 + FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE ) , EVEN IF 
 + SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
 + DAMAGES . 
 + 
 + END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
