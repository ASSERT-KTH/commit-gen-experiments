For this , you need to find the root cause of the problem . <nl> + <nl> + The most important source for this information are the log files Forge creates for every run of the game . You can find them in the ` logs ` subdirectory of your Minecraft game directory . The most important log file is ` fml - client - latest . log ` for client instances ( singleplayer or * connecting * to a server ) and ` fml - server - latest . log ` for dedicated servers which contains all of Forge ' s and any mod ' s output . <nl> + <nl> + If you ' re faced by a crash , consult these logs files first . Near the end of the log should be a section labelled ' Minecraft Crash Report ' , and after it , one about ` a detailed walkthrough of the error , . . . ` . In these sections , you ' ll see a bunch of lines that look like <nl> + <nl> + ` ` ` <nl> + at some . words . related . to . a . mod . MoreWords ( MoreWords . java : number ) <nl> + ` ` ` <nl> + <nl> + These lines are the most important part of a crash log , called the stacktrace , because they pinpoint the place in the code where something went irrecoverably wrong . Mod authors usually name their code so that these lines describe what the game was doing when it crashed . The further down one of these lines is , the earlier that piece of code ran , so at the bottom you ' ll see the place where Minecraft started , and at the top is where it stopped . You should use this information to figure out who to report the bug to . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Analyzing a Stacktrace <nl> + <nl> + You can generally tell pretty quickly what caused the error at the head of your stacktrace , simply follow these rules : <nl> + <nl> + 1 . If you can find the name of a mod in the trace , that mod most likely is the culprit . <nl> + - Be aware that you may find multiple mods as participants of a crash . In that case , you can either report to both or try to reason ( using the names in the stacktrace ) about which mod is at fault . <nl> + 2 . If you can only find Forge ( usually starting with ` net . minecraftforge ` ) alongside Vanilla ( usually starting with ` net . minecraft ` ) references , chances are that you have found a bug in Forge . In this case , use one of the various [ support channels ] ( # forge - support ) listed below . <nl> + - The occurence of a single call to Forge somewhere in the stacktrace * does not * warrant a report to Forge if there are mods present in the crash report . <nl> + 3 . If there ' s no mention of Forge or a mod , but any Vanilla class , you might have found a Vanilla bug . You should probably still report it via the Forge channels first , however , due the nature of modded environments and the rarity of Vanilla crash bugs . <nl> + 4 . Always check whether there ' s a mention of coremods at the beginning of a crash report . If there is and you can ' t find any clear culprit , consider reporting to these coremods first , since they are free to change any of the code executed in your environment . <nl> + <nl> + The rules are numbered in decreasing priority , which means that you should always prefer finding a mod in a crash report over directly jumping to conclusions about Forge or even Vanilla . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Isolating an Issue <nl> + <nl> + A significant step of reporting an issue , after having found the involved parties , is reliably reproducing it to identify potential incompatibilities or weird interactions between mods . If you ' re unable to pinpoint a bug to a set of mods and just randomly report it to any mod , chances are it won ' t get much attention and hence not a fix . <nl> + <nl> + Reliable methods of isolating the issue are listed below : <nl> + <nl> + - * * Retrace your last steps before the crash / bug occurred . * * It might sound too simple , but a big part of reliably reproducing an issue is determining the steps required to trigger it . If you can ' t exactly remember what you last did , looking at the stacktrace again can also help you a bit , since there are often descriptive names in there which reflect an action you could take , such as using an item or placing a block . <nl> + - * * Reduce the number of mod interactions . * * You can achieve this in multiple ways . One of them is simply disabling any compatibility layers between involved mods via configuration files . The other one , which takes a little more effort , is actually removing mods from your instance . But don ' t be afraid , you won ' t have to remove mods one - by - one if you follow these steps ( known as a binary search ) : <nl> + 1 . Move half the mods out of your instance ( obviously keep those definitely participating in the issue ) . <nl> + 2 . If the issue persists after another try of reproducing it , repeat from step 1 one by halving the mod list again . <nl> + 3 . If the issue does not occur anymore without the other half , repeat from step 1 but instead discard the half you just used and split the other one ( plus any definitely required mods ) . <nl> + 4 . Repeat these steps until you can ' t remove any more mods from your instance without also ' solving ' the issue . This set of mods can serve as a basis for your issue report . <nl> + <nl> + Choosing the Correct Support Channel <nl> + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <nl> + <nl> + The place you need to report issues to varies depending on the source of the problem . Below you can find a list of support channels you can usually consult for each of the sources listed in the previous section . <nl> + <nl> + Please note that this list has to be considered incomplete as there is a large number of sub - communities within the Minecraft modding world . You should always prefer channels you know and have access to over any of those listed below which would require extra effort on your part . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Forge Support <nl> + <nl> + If you ' re certain you ' ve found an issue that is directly caused by Forge , you have the following three platforms available for dealing with it , with decreasing relevance for end - users : <nl> + <nl> + 1 . * * Forge Forums : * * There ' s a dedicated [ Support & Bug Report ] ( http : / / www . minecraftforge . net / forum / forum / 18 - support - bug - reports / ) section on the Forge forums , which is led by team of moderators and volunteers who will try to deal with your reports as quickly as possible . * As a player you should probably report here first . * <nl> + - For modders , there also is a separate [ Modder Support ] ( http : / / www . minecraftforge . net / forum / forum / 70 - modder - support / ) section where you can ask all your development - related questions . * You should prefer this section for coding help . * <nl> + 2 . * * Forge IRC Channel : * * You can find a lot of help on the official [ ` # minecraftforge ` ] ( irc : / / irc . esper . net : 6667 / minecraftforge ) channel on EsperNet . Especially smaller issues that you quickly need help with could be reported there . * Be aware that the channel is more suited towards development questions , so while you may get support there as a player , you should almost always prefer the forums . * <nl> + 3 . * * Forge Issue Tracker : * * If you ' re absolutely certain that you ' ve found an issue in the Forge codebase ( e . g . you ' re a modder yourself and have analyzed the stacktrace and relevant code ) , don ' t refrain from reporting it on this repository ' s [ issue tracker ] ( https : / / github . com / MinecraftForge / MinecraftForge / issues ) . * Please do not use the issues as a means of getting coding help . For developers , the IRC and the [ official documentation ] ( https : / / mcforge . readthedocs . io ) are the best sources of information . * <nl> + <nl> + # # # Mod Support <nl> + <nl> + A lot of mods also use GitHub or other source management systems and their integrated issue trackers . The following options will give you the best chances of reporting your issue in the right place : <nl> + <nl> + - * * CurseForge : * * Many mods are hosted on the [ CurseForge platform ] ( https : / / minecraft . curseforge . com ) nowadays . Chances are you already downloaded them from there or as a part of a modpack hosted there . Projects may specify an issue reporting link on their own page , so simply look for it on the mod ' s project page and you should be directed to the preferred means of error reporting . <nl> + - * * Searching for a repository directly : * * You may need to try and find a repository directly on source control sites . The most common ones are [ GitHub ] ( https : / / github . com ) and [ BitBucket ] ( https : / / bitbucket . org ) . Both come with search capabilities , so simply try to search for the mod ' s name . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Vanilla Support <nl> + <nl> + Just like Forge or mods , Mojang has its own issue tracker for Vanilla Minecraft . This official [ bug tracker ] ( https : / / bugs . mojang . com / projects / MC / issues / ) has the exclusive purpose of managing any concrete issues with the game ' s code and functionality . It is * not * a place for requesting any features or getting help with playing the game , similar to the Forge issue tracker . <nl> + <nl> + Writing a Helpful Bug Report <nl> + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <nl> + <nl> + Now that you ' ve identified the source of your issue and decided on the correct support channel , it ' s time to actually write your report . Before you actually try to blindly create it , however , you should first check if the problem was noticed or even fixed already . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Preventing Duplicates and Unnecessary Reports <nl> + Use the target issue tracker ' s search functionality to look for issues which have descriptions similar to yours , but make sure to also search for already closed issues . If you can find one , verify it is in fact the same ( or a very similar issue ) and simply comment on it if you have anything else to contribute to the discussion , such as other steps to reproduce it . * Do not create duplicates of an existing issue , since it only puts extra effort on maintainers to recognize and close / mark them . * <nl> + <nl> + Additionally , always check the * latest * changelogs of Forge and participating mods to find out if the bug was already noticed and fixed by the developer . Often the maintainer may only support newer versions of the game , so also check the changelogs for versions of Minecraft you don ' t actually actively play . If the issue was adressed already , * do not report it * , even if the fix only exists for a newer version of the game , since the developer probably had a good reason to do so . If your issue only exists with versions of a mod that are for very old versions of the game , also refrain from reporting them , considering most modders only support the two latest versions of Minecraft , if at all . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Required Information <nl> + If you ' re certain that your issue went unnoticed up until now , you can get to actually writing up the report . Below you can find a list of the * required * information any bug report should contain : <nl> + <nl> + - * * Minecraft Version : * * Although many developers can deduce the Minecraft version in use from the mod ' s version , it is still an important piece of information to include , since it helps maintainers more easily decide whether to look into your issue at all or whether to close it right away due to being for an outdated version . <nl> + - * * Forge Version : * * The Forge API is in constant flux and while breaking changes are limited to major Minecraft updates , new bugs or regressions might creep in during active development or newer versions than a mod was built with might change semantics slightly that manifest themselves for this mod . <nl> + - * * Mod Version : * * Just like the Forge and Minecraft version , this is crucial for quickly telling where an issue might come from . * If you ' re reporting an issue caused by Forge that only occurs with a certain mod installed , include this mod here . No mod version is required if it ' s a pure Forge bug . * <nl> + - * * Complete List of Mods : * * In order to reliably analyze a bug , developers need the exact same context as you do when trying to find its cause . Hence , you should always include a * full list of mods with their corresponding version * in your report . Note that you should probably only include the ones you found by [ isolating the issue ] ( # isolating - an - issue ) . <nl> + - * * Steps to Reproduce : * * You should always include a list of steps required to provoke an issue to occur . Without it , developers can only take rough guesses at what might cause the bug . Try to reduce the amount of steps to a bare minimum , to make reproducing the issue easier . If you require a sophisticated setup to get even close to the issue , you might want to consider including your save file in your report . <nl> + - * * Full Log : * * This is probably the most important part of your bug report . You * always * have to include the full log ( ` fml - client - latest . log ` or ` fml - server - latest . log ` from earlier ) , since it is the only way of telling what has caused an issue in code . * Do not * paste the full log as plain text in your report , but use a site like [ Pastebin ] ( https : / / pastebin . com ) or [ GitHub Gist ] ( https : / / gist . github . com ) instead and link to that from your report . <nl> + <nl> + # # # Markdown Issue Template <nl> + GitHub and BitBucket allow you to use the Markdown format for writing your issues . Below you can find a simple template that you can copy and fill in with your data . ` { variables } ` are written in braces and are supposed to be replaced by you with the information the variable name indicates . Everything behind two slashes ( ` / / ` ) has to be interpreted as a comment and should be removed . If you want to include any link , you have to write in the ` [ title ] ( url ) ` form . For further information on Markdown , see [ this cheatsheet ] ( https : / / github . com / adam - p / markdown - here / wiki / Markdown - Cheatsheet ) . <nl> + <nl> + ` ` ` markdown <nl> + * * Minecraft Version : * * { mc version } <nl> + <nl> + * * Forge Version : * * { forge version } <nl> + <nl> + * * Mod Version : * * { mod version } / / Remove this line if you ' re reporting to Forge and no specific mod is involved <nl> + <nl> + [ * * Full Log * * ] ( { link to gist / pastebin with full log } ) <nl> + <nl> + * * Mods in This Instance : * * <nl> + | Name | Version | <nl> + | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - | <nl> + | [ { mod 1 } ] ( { download 1 } ) | { version 1 } | / / The download links are entirely optional <nl> + | { mod 2 } | { version 2 } | <nl> + | { mod 3 } | { version 3 } | <nl> + | . . . | . . . | <nl> + <nl> + * * Steps to Reproduce : * * <nl> + 1 . Do this <nl> + 2 . Then do that <nl> + 3 . . . . <nl> + ` ` ` <nl> + <nl> + * Note : The mod list here is formatted as table for easy reading ( when displayed ) and to look nice in text . Markdown does not care about any alignment of the spaces , so you can simply write individual rows of the table as * ` | { mod name } | { version } | ` * without having to care about the spacing . * <nl> + <nl> + # # # Waiting for an Issue to Be Resolved <nl> + After you have written your bug report , it is time to * wait * . Please be * patient * after submitting your issue , since it probably isn ' t the only one . If there ' s no response after 5 minutes or even a day of writing it , * do not * try to bump the issue by commenting on it , people * will * read it in due time . The only excuse for bumping a report is if it is a * critical * bug that prevents you from playing the game . <nl> + <nl> + Every project has a different way of dealing with issues , so don ' t wonder if there ' s no comment on it , but somebody " labels " it with certain markers . This helps developers to more easily keep track of bugs and priorities . When any further input from you is required , you will be asked specifically . Do not bug anyone through other channels about resolving your issue . <nl> + <nl> + Once your issue is closed , you will know whether it was valid or turned out to be irreproducible . If you included all of the data from above in your report , chances are that the latter won ' t be the case . <nl> \ No newline at end of file

 + Identifying the Source of a Problem 
 + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 + 
 + You ' re most likely to get fast and valuable responses to your issues if you report them in the correct place . For this , you need to find the root cause of the problem . 
 + 
 + The most important source for this information are the log files Forge creates for every run of the game . You can find them in the ` logs ` subdirectory of your Minecraft game directory . The most important log file is ` fml - client - latest . log ` for client instances ( singleplayer or * connecting * to a server ) and ` fml - server - latest . log ` for dedicated servers which contains all of Forge ' s and any mod ' s output . 
 + 
 + If you ' re faced by a crash , consult these logs files first . Near the end of the log should be a section labelled ' Minecraft Crash Report ' , and after it , one about ` a detailed walkthrough of the error , . . . ` . In these sections , you ' ll see a bunch of lines that look like 
 + 
 + ` ` ` 
 + at some . words . related . to . a . mod . MoreWords ( MoreWords . java : number ) 
 + ` ` ` 
 + 
 + These lines are the most important part of a crash log , called the stacktrace , because they pinpoint the place in the code where something went irrecoverably wrong . Mod authors usually name their code so that these lines describe what the game was doing when it crashed . The further down one of these lines is , the earlier that piece of code ran , so at the bottom you ' ll see the place where Minecraft started , and at the top is where it stopped . You should use this information to figure out who to report the bug to . 
 + 
 + # # # Analyzing a Stacktrace 
 + 
 + You can generally tell pretty quickly what caused the error at the head of your stacktrace , simply follow these rules : 
 + 
 + 1 . If you can find the name of a mod in the trace , that mod most likely is the culprit . 
 + - Be aware that you may find multiple mods as participants of a crash . In that case , you can either report to both or try to reason ( using the names in the stacktrace ) about which mod is at fault . 
 + 2 . If you can only find Forge ( usually starting with ` net . minecraftforge ` ) alongside Vanilla ( usually starting with ` net . minecraft ` ) references , chances are that you have found a bug in Forge . In this case , use one of the various [ support channels ] ( # forge - support ) listed below . 
 + - The occurence of a single call to Forge somewhere in the stacktrace * does not * warrant a report to Forge if there are mods present in the crash report . 
 + 3 . If there ' s no mention of Forge or a mod , but any Vanilla class , you might have found a Vanilla bug . You should probably still report it via the Forge channels first , however , due the nature of modded environments and the rarity of Vanilla crash bugs . 
 + 4 . Always check whether there ' s a mention of coremods at the beginning of a crash report . If there is and you can ' t find any clear culprit , consider reporting to these coremods first , since they are free to change any of the code executed in your environment . 
 + 
 + The rules are numbered in decreasing priority , which means that you should always prefer finding a mod in a crash report over directly jumping to conclusions about Forge or even Vanilla . 
 + 
 + # # # Isolating an Issue 
 + 
 + A significant step of reporting an issue , after having found the involved parties , is reliably reproducing it to identify potential incompatibilities or weird interactions between mods . If you ' re unable to pinpoint a bug to a set of mods and just randomly report it to any mod , chances are it won ' t get much attention and hence not a fix . 
 + 
 + Reliable methods of isolating the issue are listed below : 
 + 
 + - * * Retrace your last steps before the crash / bug occurred . * * It might sound too simple , but a big part of reliably reproducing an issue is determining the steps required to trigger it . If you can ' t exactly remember what you last did , looking at the stacktrace again can also help you a bit , since there are often descriptive names in there which reflect an action you could take , such as using an item or placing a block . 
 + - * * Reduce the number of mod interactions . * * You can achieve this in multiple ways . One of them is simply disabling any compatibility layers between involved mods via configuration files . The other one , which takes a little more effort , is actually removing mods from your instance . But don ' t be afraid , you won ' t have to remove mods one - by - one if you follow these steps ( known as a binary search ) : 
 + 1 . Move half the mods out of your instance ( obviously keep those definitely participating in the issue ) . 
 + 2 . If the issue persists after another try of reproducing it , repeat from step 1 one by halving the mod list again . 
 + 3 . If the issue does not occur anymore without the other half , repeat from step 1 but instead discard the half you just used and split the other one ( plus any definitely required mods ) . 
 + 4 . Repeat these steps until you can ' t remove any more mods from your instance without also ' solving ' the issue . This set of mods can serve as a basis for your issue report . 
 + 
 + Choosing the Correct Support Channel 
 + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 + 
 + The place you need to report issues to varies depending on the source of the problem . Below you can find a list of support channels you can usually consult for each of the sources listed in the previous section . 
 + 
 + Please note that this list has to be considered incomplete as there is a large number of sub - communities within the Minecraft modding world . You should always prefer channels you know and have access to over any of those listed below which would require extra effort on your part . 
 + 
 + # # # Forge Support 
 + 
 + If you ' re certain you ' ve found an issue that is directly caused by Forge , you have the following three platforms available for dealing with it , with decreasing relevance for end - users : 
 + 
 + 1 . * * Forge Forums : * * There ' s a dedicated [ Support & Bug Report ] ( http : / / www . minecraftforge . net / forum / forum / 18 - support - bug - reports / ) section on the Forge forums , which is led by team of moderators and volunteers who will try to deal with your reports as quickly as possible . * As a player you should probably report here first . * 
 + - For modders , there also is a separate [ Modder Support ] ( http : / / www . minecraftforge . net / forum / forum / 70 - modder - support / ) section where you can ask all your development - related questions . * You should prefer this section for coding help . * 
 + 2 . * * Forge IRC Channel : * * You can find a lot of help on the official [ ` # minecraftforge ` ] ( irc : / / irc . esper . net : 6667 / minecraftforge ) channel on EsperNet . Especially smaller issues that you quickly need help with could be reported there . * Be aware that the channel is more suited towards development questions , so while you may get support there as a player , you should almost always prefer the forums . * 
 + 3 . * * Forge Issue Tracker : * * If you ' re absolutely certain that you ' ve found an issue in the Forge codebase ( e . g . you ' re a modder yourself and have analyzed the stacktrace and relevant code ) , don ' t refrain from reporting it on this repository ' s [ issue tracker ] ( https : / / github . com / MinecraftForge / MinecraftForge / issues ) . * Please do not use the issues as a means of getting coding help . For developers , the IRC and the [ official documentation ] ( https : / / mcforge . readthedocs . io ) are the best sources of information . * 
 + 
 + # # # Mod Support 
 + 
 + A lot of mods also use GitHub or other source management systems and their integrated issue trackers . The following options will give you the best chances of reporting your issue in the right place : 
 + 
 + - * * CurseForge : * * Many mods are hosted on the [ CurseForge platform ] ( https : / / minecraft . curseforge . com ) nowadays . Chances are you already downloaded them from there or as a part of a modpack hosted there . Projects may specify an issue reporting link on their own page , so simply look for it on the mod ' s project page and you should be directed to the preferred means of error reporting . 
 + - * * Searching for a repository directly : * * You may need to try and find a repository directly on source control sites . The most common ones are [ GitHub ] ( https : / / github . com ) and [ BitBucket ] ( https : / / bitbucket . org ) . Both come with search capabilities , so simply try to search for the mod ' s name . 
 + 
 + # # # Vanilla Support 
 + 
 + Just like Forge or mods , Mojang has its own issue tracker for Vanilla Minecraft . This official [ bug tracker ] ( https : / / bugs . mojang . com / projects / MC / issues / ) has the exclusive purpose of managing any concrete issues with the game ' s code and functionality . It is * not * a place for requesting any features or getting help with playing the game , similar to the Forge issue tracker . 
 + 
 + Writing a Helpful Bug Report 
 + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 + 
 + Now that you ' ve identified the source of your issue and decided on the correct support channel , it ' s time to actually write your report . Before you actually try to blindly create it , however , you should first check if the problem was noticed or even fixed already . 
 + 
 + # # # Preventing Duplicates and Unnecessary Reports 
 + Use the target issue tracker ' s search functionality to look for issues which have descriptions similar to yours , but make sure to also search for already closed issues . If you can find one , verify it is in fact the same ( or a very similar issue ) and simply comment on it if you have anything else to contribute to the discussion , such as other steps to reproduce it . * Do not create duplicates of an existing issue , since it only puts extra effort on maintainers to recognize and close / mark them . * 
 + 
 + Additionally , always check the * latest * changelogs of Forge and participating mods to find out if the bug was already noticed and fixed by the developer . Often the maintainer may only support newer versions of the game , so also check the changelogs for versions of Minecraft you don ' t actually actively play . If the issue was adressed already , * do not report it * , even if the fix only exists for a newer version of the game , since the developer probably had a good reason to do so . If your issue only exists with versions of a mod that are for very old versions of the game , also refrain from reporting them , considering most modders only support the two latest versions of Minecraft , if at all . 
 + 
 + # # # Required Information 
 + If you ' re certain that your issue went unnoticed up until now , you can get to actually writing up the report . Below you can find a list of the * required * information any bug report should contain : 
 + 
 + - * * Minecraft Version : * * Although many developers can deduce the Minecraft version in use from the mod ' s version , it is still an important piece of information to include , since it helps maintainers more easily decide whether to look into your issue at all or whether to close it right away due to being for an outdated version . 
 + - * * Forge Version : * * The Forge API is in constant flux and while breaking changes are limited to major Minecraft updates , new bugs or regressions might creep in during active development or newer versions than a mod was built with might change semantics slightly that manifest themselves for this mod . 
 + - * * Mod Version : * * Just like the Forge and Minecraft version , this is crucial for quickly telling where an issue might come from . * If you ' re reporting an issue caused by Forge that only occurs with a certain mod installed , include this mod here . No mod version is required if it ' s a pure Forge bug . * 
 + - * * Complete List of Mods : * * In order to reliably analyze a bug , developers need the exact same context as you do when trying to find its cause . Hence , you should always include a * full list of mods with their corresponding version * in your report . Note that you should probably only include the ones you found by [ isolating the issue ] ( # isolating - an - issue ) . 
 + - * * Steps to Reproduce : * * You should always include a list of steps required to provoke an issue to occur . Without it , developers can only take rough guesses at what might cause the bug . Try to reduce the amount of steps to a bare minimum , to make reproducing the issue easier . If you require a sophisticated setup to get even close to the issue , you might want to consider including your save file in your report . 
 + - * * Full Log : * * This is probably the most important part of your bug report . You * always * have to include the full log ( ` fml - client - latest . log ` or ` fml - server - latest . log ` from earlier ) , since it is the only way of telling what has caused an issue in code . * Do not * paste the full log as plain text in your report , but use a site like [ Pastebin ] ( https : / / pastebin . com ) or [ GitHub Gist ] ( https : / / gist . github . com ) instead and link to that from your report . 
 + 
 + # # # Markdown Issue Template 
 + GitHub and BitBucket allow you to use the Markdown format for writing your issues . Below you can find a simple template that you can copy and fill in with your data . ` { variables } ` are written in braces and are supposed to be replaced by you with the information the variable name indicates . Everything behind two slashes ( ` / / ` ) has to be interpreted as a comment and should be removed . If you want to include any link , you have to write in the ` [ title ] ( url ) ` form . For further information on Markdown , see [ this cheatsheet ] ( https : / / github . com / adam - p / markdown - here / wiki / Markdown - Cheatsheet ) . 
 + 
 + ` ` ` markdown 
 + * * Minecraft Version : * * { mc version } 
 + 
 + * * Forge Version : * * { forge version } 
 + 
 + * * Mod Version : * * { mod version } / / Remove this line if you ' re reporting to Forge and no specific mod is involved 
 + 
 + [ * * Full Log * * ] ( { link to gist / pastebin with full log } ) 
 + 
 + * * Mods in This Instance : * * 
 + | Name | Version | 
 + | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - | 
 + | [ { mod 1 } ] ( { download 1 } ) | { version 1 } | / / The download links are entirely optional 
 + | { mod 2 } | { version 2 } | 
 + | { mod 3 } | { version 3 } | 
 + | . . . | . . . | 
 + 
 + * * Steps to Reproduce : * * 
 + 1 . Do this 
 + 2 . Then do that 
 + 3 . . . . 
 + ` ` ` 
 + 
 + * Note : The mod list here is formatted as table for easy reading ( when displayed ) and to look nice in text . Markdown does not care about any alignment of the spaces , so you can simply write individual rows of the table as * ` | { mod name } | { version } | ` * without having to care about the spacing . * 
 + 
 + # # # Waiting for an Issue to Be Resolved 
 + After you have written your bug report , it is time to * wait * . Please be * patient * after submitting your issue , since it probably isn ' t the only one . If there ' s no response after 5 minutes or even a day of writing it , * do not * try to bump the issue by commenting on it , people * will * read it in due time . The only excuse for bumping a report is if it is a * critical * bug that prevents you from playing the game . 
 + 
 + Every project has a different way of dealing with issues , so don ' t wonder if there ' s no comment on it , but somebody " labels " it with certain markers . This helps developers to more easily keep track of bugs and priorities . When any further input from you is required , you will be asked specifically . Do not bug anyone through other channels about resolving your issue . 
 + 
 + Once your issue is closed , you will know whether it was valid or turned out to be irreproducible . If you included all of the data from above in your report , chances are that the latter won ' t be the case .

 + ScotTools Background : ScotTools was an API that enabled modders to add blocks to harvesting levels ( and many other ease - of - use features to create new tools ) , and the first tool API that used block material for block breaking efficiency which allowed blocks from mods that didn ' t use ScotTools API to break with the correct speed .
