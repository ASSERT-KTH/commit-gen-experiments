 @ @ - 8 , 11 + 8 , 12 @ @ Eventually , in rev4 of MTProto we will eliminate using of TLS for better speed a 
 MTProtoV2 uses Curve25519 for performing DH for calculating AuthKey . 
 
 This technique use [ TLS 1 . 2 RFC ] ( https : / / tools . ietf . org / html / rfc5246 ) for it ' s basis and doesn ' t try to invent wheel , but improves performance of TLS : 
 - 1 ) Not sending server certificates if not needed on every connection . 
 - 2 ) One DiffieHellman to build one shared secret without repeating on almost every reconnect . ( we will implement PFS in next revision of MTProto v2 ) 
 - 3 ) Using only Curve25519 and AES - CBC 
 - 4 ) Extending master _ secret to make it 256 bytes long 
 - 5 ) Added Signing of response just to check that everything is ok and add one more protection level
